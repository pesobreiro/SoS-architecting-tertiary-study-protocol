> studies, smart cities rely on information and communication
> technologies for col- lecting data from several urban sensors, such as
> electric me- ters, GPS devices, building sensors, and weather sensors,
> which can range from simple sensors to complex SANs. In order to be
> used in management, education, health care, transportation, and public
> safety services of a smart city, these sensor systems can be
> associated to a building, a fac- tory, city roads, or even to a whole
> city. With the informa- tion provided by IoT, such systems would be
> able to elabo- rate complex decision-making processes and communicate
> to each other by combining the information that they provide. In this
> perspective, smart cities can clearly be viewed as an example of SoS
> leveraged by the IoT paradigm, which would provide the levels of
> information that smart cities require for their constituent systems.
