> Cyber-physical systems and SoS. Cyber-physical systems (CPS) can be
> defined as large, complex networked informa- tion systems that
> interact with physical processes and en- vironments through
> geographically distributed devices. As networked information systems,
> CPS encompass computa- tion, human activities, and automated
> decision-making en- abled by information and communication technology.
> More- over, they are aimed at monitoring, controlling, and inte-
> grating physical processes and environments to support op- erations
> and management in the physical worlds \[8\]. CPS can scale from
> micro-level, embedded systems to large, com- plex SoS composed of
> heterogeneous IoT-based constituent systems or even other CPS, besides
> exhibiting typical fea- tures of SoS such as distributed control,
> independence of the constituent systems, emergent behaviors,
> evolutionary development, etc. In this context, a promising initiative
> is the CPSoS Project \[5\], an European consortium started on October
> 2013 that aims to identify industrial and societal needs and the state
> of the art of tools and theories for the
>
> research and development of cyber-physical SoS in the next years.

> IoT-based SoS have been deployed. We have noticed that three of the
> five selected studies (S1, S2, and S3 ) target smart cities as the
> main reference scenario for their proposals. As presented in these
> studies, smart cities rely on information and communication
> technologies for col- lecting data from several urban sensors, such as
> electric me- ters, GPS devices, building sensors, and weather sensors,
> which can range from simple sensors to complex SANs. In order to be
> used in management, education, health care, transportation, and public
> safety services of a smart city, these sensor systems can be
> associated to a building, a fac- tory, city roads, or even to a whole
> city. With the informa- tion provided by IoT, such systems would be
> able to elabo- rate complex decision-making processes and communicate
> to each other by combining the information that they provide. In this
> perspective, smart cities can clearly be viewed as an example of SoS
> leveraged by the IoT paradigm, which would provide the levels of
> information that smart cities require for their constituent systems.
