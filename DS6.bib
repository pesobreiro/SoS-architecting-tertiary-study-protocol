	abstract = {This article establishes a tri-level decision-making model supporting critical infrastructure (CI) resilience optimization against intentional attacks. A novel decomposition algorithm is proposed to exactly identify the best pre-event defense strategy (protecting vulnerable components and building new lines), the worst-case attack scenario, and the optimal postevent repair sequence of damaged components. As different types of CIs have different flow models, this article mainly considers the direct current power flow model and the maximal flow model for illustrative purposes. The proposed framework is illustrated by a simple but representative case system with nine nodes, and main results include: (1) the marginal value of extra defense investment under low defense budget is more considerable for mitigating system resilience loss, especially under large intentional attacks; (2) no defense strategy is always the best under different attack budgets; (3) increasing amount of repair resources can dramatically enhance CI resilience, but makes the pre-event defense strategy less effective; (4) the use of maximal flow model can provide a lower bound estimation of the resilience loss from the power flow model; (5) the optimum defense strategy and the worst-case attack identified by minimizing CI resilience loss largely differ from those by minimizing CI vulnerability, where the latter does not consider the recovery actions. Finally, the algorithm complexity is analyzed by comparing with the enumeration method and by testing two larger electric power systems.},

	abstract = {Infrastructure systems are critical for society's resilience, government operation, and overall defense. Thereby, it is imperative to develop informative and computationally efficient analysis methods for infrastructure systems, which reveal system vulnerabilities and recoverability. To capture practical constraints in systems analyses, various layers of complexity play a role, including limited element capacities, restoration resources, and the presence of interdependence among systems. High-fidelity modeling such as mixed integer programming and physics-based modeling can often be computationally expensive, making time-sensitive analyses challenging. Furthermore, the complexity of recovery solutions can reduce analysis transparency. An alternative, presented in this work, is a reduced-order representation, dubbed a recovery operator, of a high-fidelity time-dependent recovery model of a system of interdependent networks. The form of the operator is assumed to be a time-invariant linear dynamic model apt for infrastructure restoration. The recovery operator is generated by applying system identification techniques to numerous disaster and recovery scenarios. The proposed compact representation provides simple yet powerful information regarding systemic recovery dynamics, and enables generating fast suboptimal recovery policies in time-critical applications.},

Aims We propose a reuse value assessment framework, intended to provide a more nuanced view of the value and costs associated with different reuse candidates. Method This framework is constructed based on findings from an interview study at a large software development company. Results The framework considers the functionality, compliance to standards, provided quality, and provided support of a reuse candidate, thus enabling an informed comparison between different reuse candidates. Furthermore, the framework provides means for tracking the value of the reused asset throughout subsequent releases. Conclusions The reuse value assessment framework is a tool to assist in the selection between different reuse candidates. The framework also provides a means to assess the current value of a reusable asset in a product, which can be used to indicate where maintenance efforts would increase the utilized potential of the reusable asset.},

The proposed empirical approach leverages the complementary application of three techniques, an algorithmic estimation model, Monte Carlo simulation, and portfolio management. Our case study findings show how the ability of our approach to model uncertainty allows practitioners to address the challenging question of how to adjust project context factors so that chances of project success are increased. We also include a discussion on the implications of our approach for practice as well as on the possible validity threats and what the practitioner could do to counterpart them.

Many safety requirements are imposed by various standards and industrial regulations that must be met by avionics software. One of such standards is DO-178B/C, which provides guidelines (e.g., development process and objectives to satisfy in development activities) for meeting safety requirements. This paper presents a modeling methodology including a UML profile for specifying safety requirements on a component-based architecture model and a set of design guidelines on avionics software. These safety requirements were identified from both standards (mainly DO-178B/C) and current engineering practices in the domain of avionics systems. The methodology automatically enforces these safety requirements. We have applied the methodology on an industrial autopilot system, and several previously uncaught faults were revealed.

	abstract = {Context The advances in information and communication technologies have revolutionized the software development environment from local to global software development (GSD). This revolution also created challenges for vendor organizations. Vendors face challenges in integrating the components developed independently by GSD teams into a final working product. Objective The objectives of the current study is to find out those critical barriers/challenges that hinder the integration process at any stage in the GSD environment for different types and size of projects. Methodology For achieving the objectives we initially conducted a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR). We searched 6 digital libraries and also followed the snowballing technique. The data was extracted from a total of 88 finally selected papers. Findings of the SLR study were then empirically validated through a questionnaire survey in GSD industry. A total of 96 experts from 22 different countries participated in the survey. Results We have found a total of 16 barriers/challenges among which ten barriers are ranked as critical barriers/challenges. Some of the top ranked barriers are “lack of communication,” “lack of proper documentation,” “lack of compatibility,” and “architecture mismatch.” The findings of our industrial survey are mostly coherent with the SLR findings. However, there is a difference in ranks of the various barriers/challenges across the 2 data sets (SLR and industrial survey). The identified challenges need to be properly addressed by software vendors to reduce the complexity of the integration process in GSD projects. Conclusion We found that the severity of these barriers increases in large size projects. On the other hand, bespoke products are more affected by “lack of communication,” while off-the-shelf–based projects face integration problems due to “lack of compatibility,” “architecture mismatch,” and “wrong off the shelf product selection and customization”.},

	abstract = {In recent years, more and more efforts have been devoted in supporting the design of systems-of-systems (SoS). Designing such systems is a multidisciplinary problem which involves considering emergent phenomena, assuring the achievement of dependability/security requirements, guaranteeing system responsiveness, and supporting dynamicity/evolution and multicriticality of provided services. A first step towards a viable design approach is to provide a conceptual model of SoS which captures SoS concepts, and their interrelationships aiming at enhancing the understandability of SoS to stakeholders and providing the basis for further automated analysis. In this context, the AMADEOS European project is bringing together researchers and practitioners to provide the support to design SoS starting from the definition of a domain specific ontology serving as a vocabulary for SoS. Our contribution consists in the modeling of the key SoS concepts and relationships defined in AMADEOS adopting a systems modeling language visual modeling language. We propose a systems modeling language profile for SoS, and we show its applicability in a Smart Grid scenario. We show how to use the profile in a model-driven engineering process to support different types of analyses, and we discuss how to integrate the profile in a user-friendly model-driven engineering tool for SoS rapid modeling, validation, code-generation, and simulation.},

Several policies are discussed in the chapter to exemplify areas of effective policy design and domains for future work. Preference relations can be used to evaluate alternatives, but more importantly to create alternatives that complement the modeled value systems. In modeling complex adaptive systems, the focus is on how local interactions create global structures and patterns. The chapter reviews the systems-level implications of uncertainty and unpredictability in risk management for policy development. A SoS model of the global food system is discussed in the hope of developing the understanding of the system and to provide insight into which policy mechanisms may work to achieve global food security.},

In recent years, health care has become one of the most important services due to the continuous increases in its costs. This has motivated extensive research on health care CPS, and some of that research has focused on describing the software architecture behind these systems. However, there is no secondary study to consolidate the research. This paper aims to identify and compare existing research on software architectures for health care CPS in order to determine successful solutions that could guide other architects and practitioners in their health care projects. We conducted a systematic literature review and compared the selected studies based on a characterization schema. The research synthesis results in a knowledge base of software architectures for health care CPS, describing their stakeholders, functional and non-functional features, quality attributes architectural views and styles, components, and implementation technologies. This systematic literature review also identifies research gaps, such as the lack of open common platforms, as well as directions for future research.},

The chapter defines system of systems engineering and provides an overview of engineering and modeling and simulation approaches prescribed for that context. It highlights the engineering principles that are particularly relevant in a system of systems context. Then systems engineering methodology is prescribed for federation development.

In order to confront one of the most challenging features of a huge design space in capability based analysis (CBA), a literature review of design space exploration was first examined. Then, in the process of an aerospace system of systems design space exploration, a bilayer mapping method was put forward, based on the existing experimental and operating data. Finally, the feasibility of the foregoing approach was demonstrated with an illustrative example. With the data mining RST (rough sets theory) and SOM(self-organized mapping) techniques, the alternative to the aerospace system of systems architecture was mapping from P-space (performance space) to C-space (configuration space), and then from C-space to D-space (design space), respectively. Ultimately, the performance space was mapped to the design space, which completed the exploration and preliminary reduction of the entire design space. This method provides a computational analysis and implementation scheme for large-scale simulation.},

This paper provides an overview of NEC, representing it as a complex human activity system of systems (SoS), analysis of which cannot rely on purely traditional reductionist engineering approaches, requiring instead a soft-systems engineering approach. A literature review is then provided, covering nontraditional systems methodologies of the past 25 years, highlighting the more recent trend towards multimethodological practice. The paper introduces the systemic diagram, or systemigram, conceptual model, explaining its evolution from a form of visual language to its use as an appreciative learning system in a soft-systems methodology. Using the written prose of MoD policy makers, a systemigram model is constructed which represents the NEC concept, providing a systemic visualization of its complexity and an elucidation of the key SoS attributes of emergence, hierarchy, and boundary. Finally, the NEC systemigram is used in an example storyboarding technique, demonstrating its utility as a platform for stakeholder dialog leading towards a refined model that reflects a deeper understanding of NEC strategy.

According to the researches and discussions in recent years, we believe that most researchers have already established a comprehensive understanding about CPS. This paper systematically introduced CPS's conception, development and applications assisted. In addition, concerning about its aspects of safety and security, we also analyzed CPS's risks and new requirements as an up-to-date technique brings. We elaborate the existing work and propose a research focus that has not been paid enough attention to, and proposed a security framework for CPS.

	abstract = {There is an urgent need for a trans-disciplinary approach for the collective evaluation of engineered nanomaterial (ENM) benefits and risks. Currently, research studies are mostly focused on examining effects at individual end-points with emphasis on ENM risk effects. Less research work is pursuing the integration needed to advance the science of sustainable ENMs. Therefore, the primary objective of this article is to discuss the system-of-systems (SoS) approach as a broad and integrated paradigm to examine ENM benefits and risks to society, environment, and economy (SEE) within a sustainability context. The aims are focused on: (a) current approaches in the scientific literature and the need for a broad and integrated approach, (b) documentation of ENM SoS in terms of architecture and governing rules and practices within sustainability context, and (c) implementation plan for the road ahead. In essence, the SoS architecture is a communication vehicle offering the opportunity to track benefits and risks in an integrated fashion so as to understand the implications and make decisions about advancing the science of sustainable ENMs. In support of the SoS architecture, we propose using an analytic-based decision support system consisting of a knowledge base and analytic engine along the benefit and risk informatics routes in the SEE system to build sound decisions on what constitutes sustainable and unsustainable ENMs in spite of the existing uncertainties and knowledge gaps. The work presented herein is neither a systematic review nor a critical appraisal of the scientific literature.

In order to invest, make decisions, and effectively manage technology developments, “should-cost” estimates are used to baseline systems to what is considered affordable over the lifecycle. In addition to a higher likelihood for overrun, complex systems traditionally require major acquisitions, budgets, and development schedules where failure results in increased cost consequences. Behavioral properties (such as emergence) can influence performance resulting in dynamic and unpredictable effects on networked platform operation, system capability, and mission effectiveness. Data analyzed from 526 major weapons programs and from subject-matter expert judgment are explored to propose: (1) a new approach to quantify these risks using prescriptive measures related to complexity, adaptability, and resilience, (2) identify leading indicators to reduce the likelihood of cost overrun, (3) suggest measurements based on research findings and systems heuristics to improve lifecycle cost estimation, and (4) present applications of Engineering Resilience to meet the growing complexity, interdependence, and scale of systems under constrained budgets with a growing demand for affordability.

Complexity has become an inseparable aspect of systems and also one of the important factors in the failure of projects. While much has been written about project complexity, there is still a lack of understanding of what constitutes project complexity. This research includes a systematic literature review to demonstrate the current understanding of commonalities and differences in the existing research. This was achieved by examining more than 420 published research papers, drawn from an original group of approximately 10,000, based on citations during the period of 1990-2015. As a result of this exploration, an integrative systemic framework is presented to demonstrate understanding of project complexity. It was found that there are three primary and distinctive models of project complexity, the Project Management Institute view, the System of Systems view and the view developed from the analysis of citations of research papers, which is called the Complexity Theories view. Further testing is required on a range of complex projects in order to attempt to reconcile these views. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.},

In an effort to clarify and consolidate terms, this conceptual research examines both supply chain management (SCM) and system of systems (SoS) literature to postulate, from a value-chain perspective, what roles integration and collaboration play in helping supply chains satisfy customer requirements. A literature review analysis was used to identify the commonalities and differences between supply chain management and system of systems approaches to examining interfirm coordination of value creation efforts. Although a framework of integration and collaboration roles in value creation is proposed, further empirical testing of the concept is required to substantiate initial conclusions. The concepts proposed may help clarify where strategic and operational managers need to focus their efforts in coordinating supply chain member firms. The incorporation of SoS engineering into the supply chain field will draw the linkage between the constituent principles, and concepts of Systems Theory as appropriate for the supply chain management field. This is the first effort to reconcile two separate but parallel scholarship streams examining the coordination of multiple organizations in value creation. This research shows that there are some methodologies, principles, and methods from the SoS field that can supplement supply chain management research. Mainly due to a unit of analysis issue, systems based approaches have not been in the mainstream of supply chain management field development.},

	abstract = {Abstract The research explores the historical development of project complexity. Projects are becoming more complex due to unexpected emergent behaviour and characteristics. Complexity has become an inseparable aspect of systems and also one of the important factors in the failure of projects. While much has been written about project complexity, there is still a lack of understanding of what constitutes project complexity. This research includes a systematic literature review to demonstrate the current understanding of commonalities and differences in the existing research. This was achieved by examining more than 420 published research papers, drawn from an original group of approximately 10,000, based on citations during the period of 1990–2015. As a result of this exploration, an integrative systemic framework is presented to demonstrate understanding of project complexity. It was found that there are three primary and distinctive models of project complexity, the Project Management Institute view, the System of Systems view and the view developed from the analysis of citations of research papers, which is called the Complexity Theories view. Further testing is required on a range of complex projects in order to attempt to reconcile these views.},

	abstract = {Abstract There is an urgent need for a trans-disciplinary approach for the collective evaluation of engineered nanomaterial (ENM) benefits and risks. Currently, research studies are mostly focused on examining effects at individual endpoints with emphasis on \{ENM\} risk effects. Less research work is pursuing the integration needed to advance the science of sustainable ENMs. Therefore, the primary objective of this article is to discuss the system-of-systems (SoS) approach as a broad and integrated paradigm to examine \{ENM\} benefits and risks to society, environment, and economy (SEE) within a sustainability context. The aims are focused on: (a) current approaches in the scientific literature and the need for a broad and integrated approach, (b) documentation of \{ENM\} SoS in terms of architecture and governing rules and practices within sustainability context, and (c) implementation plan for the road ahead. In essence, the SoS architecture is a communication vehicle offering the opportunity to track benefits and risks in an integrated fashion so as to understand the implications and make decisions about advancing the science of sustainable ENMs. In support of the SoS architecture, we propose using an analytic-based decision support system consisting of a knowledge base and analytic engine along the benefit and risk informatics routes in the \{SEE\} system to build sound decisions on what constitutes sustainable and unsustainable \{ENMs\} in spite of the existing uncertainties and knowledge gaps. The work presented herein is neither a systematic review nor a critical appraisal of the scientific literature. Rather, it is a position paper that largely expresses the views of the authors based on their expert opinion drawn from industrial and academic experience.},

	abstract = {Abstract New automated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) sensors and processing technologies provide access to ever increasing amounts of intelligence data. Effectively managing these technologies represents a profound system of systems challenge. In this study, we use system dynamics simulation to analyze and assess processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED) system performance across a range of task areas for converting collected sensor data into information and intelligence. The resulting recommendations identify emerging research, technologies, and support tools than can improve future military \{PED\} system design and performance. The analytic approach used in this study involved three tasks. First, work domain analysis based on recent \{PED\} research and doctrinal reviews were combined with knowledge gleaned from interviews with subject matter experts to identify patterns of cognitive work and categorize emerging \{PED\} system challenges. Second, we searched for an appropriate methodology and chose to take a system dynamics (SD) analysis approach to explore these challenges. This \{SD\} approach was then extended based on Cognitive Systems Engineering [6] insights and applied in a limited and controlled operational scenario to verify its efficacy. The outputs from the \{SD\} simulation were then used to identify initial findings for further analysis coupled with a \{CSE\} work domain analysis to provide a basis for future support technology research and development recommendations.},
